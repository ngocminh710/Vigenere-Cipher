# Vigenere-Cipher
This project encodes and decodes messages according to the Vigenere cipher. 

Test files:
  Short sample:  text1.txt 
Encrypted with code "d":  cipher1a.txt 
Encrypted with code "Password":  cipher1b.txt 
Decrypting with the correct code should yield the input, in all lowercase

  Longer sample:  text2.txt 
Encrypted with code "d":  cipher2a.txt 
Encrypted with code "Password":  cipher2b.txt
